# Stumpage Price Data Sources

Comprehensive inventory of timber stumpage price data sources for the contiguous United States.
Research compiled: December 2025

## Critical Findings

### What Does NOT Contain Stumpage Prices

| Database | What It Contains | Stumpage Prices? |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **TPO (Timber Product Output)** | Harvest volumes, mill counts, residues | **NO** |
| **FIA (Forest Inventory & Analysis)** | Forest inventory, growth, removals | **NO** |
| **Cut & Sold Reports** | Total values, not unit prices | **NO** |
| **BLM Timber Data** | Contract volumes only | **NO** |

This is crucial: the two most commonly cited federal forestry databases (TPO and FIA) do not contain stumpage price data.

## Recommended Data Strategy for Forest Rents Project

### Primary Approach
1. **South**: Use NC State Extension free historical data (1976-2024) as baseline
2. **Pacific Northwest**: Use USFS PNW Research Station Excel data (1958-2023)
3. **Northeast**: Compile from state extension programs (PA, NY, VT, ME, NH)
4. **Lake States**: Use MN DNR + MI DNR free reports

### Filling Gaps
- For states without direct data, use regional averages from adjacent states
- Consider TimberMart-South subscription for research-quality Southern data
- Apply hedonic price adjustments based on FIA site index data

### Proxy Methods When Data Unavailable
1. **Residual Value Method**: Market price - transport - processing - marketing costs
2. **Hedonic Models**: Regression on timber characteristics (volume, species, quality, distance)
3. **Regional Averages**: Use adjacent state/region data with adjustments

## Data Format Considerations

| Format | Sources | Ease of Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Excel/CSV | USFS PNW, some state programs | High |
| PDF Reports | Most state extensions | Medium (requires parsing) |
| Web Tables | WA DOR, some states | Medium |
| Interactive Dashboards | Maine | High |
| Blog Posts | Clemson, OSU | Low (manual extraction) |
