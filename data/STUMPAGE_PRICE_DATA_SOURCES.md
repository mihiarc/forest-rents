## Data Gaps and Limitations

### States with Limited Public Stumpage Reporting:
- California (contact-based rather than published reports)
- Colorado (contact information only)
- Arizona (contact information only)
- Alaska (limited sources)
- Kentucky (delivered log prices, not stumpage)
- Ohio (limited public reporting)
- Nevada, Utah, New Mexico (minimal timber industry, limited data)

### Important Notes on Data Types:

**Stumpage Prices:**
- Price paid to landowner for standing timber
- Does not include harvesting, hauling, or milling costs
- Most common in Eastern U.S. and South

**Delivered/Mill Prices:**
- Price paid for logs delivered to mill
- Includes harvesting and transportation costs
- Common in Pacific Northwest and Western states
- Must subtract logging/hauling costs to estimate stumpage value

**Public vs. Private Land Sales:**
- Most public reports based on public land sales (state, federal)
- Private land stumpage may differ due to market conditions, access, timber quality
- Some states (e.g., Oregon) do not track private land stumpage values

### Regional Variations:
- Stumpage pricing methods vary significantly by region
- Contractual basis means high variability within states
- Product definitions and grading standards vary by region
- Species mixes differ substantially across the country
