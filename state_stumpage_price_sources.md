## NOTES ON DATA USAGE

### Important Considerations When Using Stumpage Price Data:

1. **Regional Variations:** Prices can vary significantly within a state based on local market conditions, mill proximity, and regional supply/demand dynamics.

2. **Quality Factors:** Reported average prices do not reflect the full range of prices paid based on timber quality, species mix, stand characteristics, and accessibility.

3. **Market Timing:** Timber markets are dynamic; reported quarterly or annual averages may not reflect current conditions, especially during periods of rapid market change.

4. **Product Specifications:** Price reports may use different measurement units (tons vs. MBF), scales (Scribner, Doyle, International), and product definitions across states.

5. **Delivered vs. Stumpage:** Some regions (particularly Pacific Northwest) report delivered log prices rather than stumpage prices. Stumpage values are typically 40-60% lower than delivered prices.

6. **Tax vs. Market Prices:** Some states (e.g., New Hampshire) publish stumpage values primarily for tax purposes, which may differ from actual market transaction prices.

7. **Sample Size:** Reports based on small numbers of transactions (indicated in some reports) should be used with extra caution.

8. **Professional Appraisal:** Nearly all state forestry agencies and extension services recommend consulting with a licensed forester or consulting forester for site-specific timber value assessments before conducting timber sales.

## DATA GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES

### States with Limited or No Public Stumpage Price Reporting:
- California (contact-based only)
- Alaska (contact-based only)
- Maryland (reports discontinued 2006)
- Delaware (reports discontinued 2006)
- Nevada (no data found)
- Utah (no data found)
- Colorado (no data found)
- Wyoming (no data found)
- New Mexico (no data found)
- Arizona (no data found)
- Hawaii (no data found)
- North Dakota (no data found)

### Opportunities for Enhanced Data Collection:
1. Standardization of measurement units and product definitions across states
2. More frequent updates in rapidly changing markets
3. Better integration of private timberland transaction data (currently limited to public land sales in many states)
4. Development of web-based interactive databases (following Maine Stumpage Dashboard model)
5. Enhanced regional coordination for border areas where markets overlap
6. Integration of market forecast information with historical price data
